# Florida has lost its mind

Florida Man is not interested in science or ending the pandemic. And by Florida Man, I mean Florida
governor Ron DeSantis. Despite [setting records for hospiral admissions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58077209),
DeSantis and Florida continue to act as COVID is over and a non-event. 

Weekly positive tests are at all time highs, despite vaccinations, etc.

So what's happening to deaths. Oh, wait, look at the flat line. Is that a bug? Nope, Florida just isn't updating its county-level
death statistics.
