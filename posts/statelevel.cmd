# Using state-level data to fill in missing county-level

I had originally built state-level results by actively summing up the county-level data.
Unfortunately, states like Florida have stopped reporting county-level data, so many graphs
started to have gaps. Since the NY Times is doing the work to build state-level data as well,
I'm now relying on their state totals rather than the sum of county-level results.
